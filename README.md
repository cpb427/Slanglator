# Slanglator

A fun slang-translating robot that roams Twitter and finds Tweets that have alot of Slang in them. When it finds a tweet with 4 slang words in it it replies to said Tweet, with the original text but translated into normal English!

This code isn't really intended for re-use, it's just here so anyone who is curious can see what runs Slanglator!
